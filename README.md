# Small-Language-Model-for-Book-Based-Question-Answering
This project aims to build a Small Language Model (SLM) capable of extracting information from a book (PDF) and answering user queries accurately. The model leverages NLP techniques, FAISS for efficient retrieval, and a transformer-based question-answering model.
